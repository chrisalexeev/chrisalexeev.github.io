            I am a backend developer working as a Data Warehouse Engineer at Trimedx. I am working on this page as I progress in my quest to become a full-stack developer. Clearly I have a long way to go, but you have to start somewhere.

            At my job, most of my time is spent on Azure DevOps pipeline automation and Snowflake data monitoring. During my two years in school, I also gained general knowledge in the following areas:
            <ul>
                <li>Data Science</li>
                <li>Machine Learning</li>
                <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
                <li>Data Mining</li>
                <li>Android App Development in Java</li>
                <li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
                <li>Theory of Computing</li>
            </ul> 
            And in my freetime during school, I gained limited experience in:
            <ul>
                <li>Raspberry Pi Home Automation</li>
                <li>Node.JS and Express</li>
                <li>React</li>
            </ul>
